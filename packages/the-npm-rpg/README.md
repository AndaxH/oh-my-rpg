The npm RPG âš”ðŸ›¡ðŸ’°
===========

This is a simple command-line RPG. Every time you launch the command, something happen!

**NOTE: very early stage of development**


## TLDR; I want to play !

Quick test, just:
```bash
> npx  the-npm-rpg
```

Full install, if you don't have npx or if you want to play faster:
```bash
> npm install --global  the-npm-rpg
> the-npm-rpg
```


## More info
Inspiration for the game itself was taken from the defunct "boring RPG" https://www.reddit.com/r/boringrpg/.

Inspiration to turn it into a command-line RPG was taken from the "npx" utility, recently integrated to npm.


## Troubleshooting
Please file a GitHub bug.

### I can't get the latest version!
npx has a cache. To force a refresh:
`npx the-npm-rpg --ignore-existing`

### I can't equip weapons/armors
In progress!!!
